Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
I understand how to do test 13 (using the pointer from calloc as a key that is mapped to the value of number of bytes allocated so that m61_free can later recall the key to free the appropriate number of bytes). However, std::map is giving me trouble and I got tons of error when attempting to use the pointer as a key.
