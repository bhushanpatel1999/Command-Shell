Halfway through problem set 4, on October 28, my grandfather passed away. I had to leave campus and go home 
for a week and a half to support my family and attend the funeral. I came back on the weekend of November 6th,
after the pset was due. I informed my Pfoho resident dean (Monique Roy) and Eddie and was granted extra late days.
Please feel free to email Eddie, me, or my resident dean with any questions or clarifications.
